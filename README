A lazy pong clone I created in about 2h for onegameamonth.com
I spend most time struggleing with box2d.

The CPU player is stupid, so the real challange are the retarded controls.

TODO:
- The Cpu paddle is horribly stupid, let it calculate the point of impact.
- The movement should use onkeydown / onkeyup instead of this lazy ai-blocker
- allow 2 player multiplayer
